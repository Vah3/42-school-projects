#  Minishell

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed
that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously
irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with
a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close
to english.The objective of this project is to create a simple shell using c.
